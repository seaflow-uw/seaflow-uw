abstract: "SQLShare is a Web-based application that emphasizes a simple upload-query-share protocol over conventional database design and uses ad hoc interactive query over general-purpose programming. Here, a case study examines the use of SQLShare as an alternative to script-based scientific workflows for a project in observational biological oceanography. Â© 1999-2011 IEEE."
