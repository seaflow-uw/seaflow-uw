SeaFlow is an underway flow cytometer that provides continuous, real-time observations of phytoplankton in the ocean. 

<!--more--> 
Unlike traditional flow cytometers, SeaFlow eliminates the need for sheath fluid, enabling continuous sampling and high-resolution data collection. 

**Key Features and Benefits**:
* **Virtual-core technology**: Enables sheathless operation, continuous sampling, and high-resolution spatial and temporal mapping of phytoplankton communities.    
* **Automated, real-time analysis**: Real-time data visualization, automated population identification, and user-friendly software for remote monitoring and control. See your live dashboard [here](https://gradientscruise.org/d/Ybbbrzqae/tn427-by-time?orgId=1).  
* **Optimized for small phytoplankton**: Specifically designed to detect and analyze surface *Prochlorococcus* and other small phytoplankton cells (0.5-10 µm) in oligotrophic waters.    
* **Robust and adaptable**: Suitable for deployment in diverse aquatic environments, from research vessels to remote field stations.    
* **Real-Time Analysis Dashboard**: Data are analyzed in real-time and broadcasted over the web. These visualizations of the data provided to scientists at sea and on land are available [here](https://gradientscruise.org/d/Ybbbrzqae/tn427-by-time?orgId=1).
