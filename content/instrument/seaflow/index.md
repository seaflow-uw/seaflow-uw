The SeaFlow instrument is a shipboard underway flow cytometer that provides continuous multi-parameter single particle measurements without the need for clean water. Detailed information can be found in [Swalwell et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2011.9.466).

The instrument eliminates the traditional need for a sheath fluid by employing a unique optical system that relies on three photodetectors to create a virtual core in the sample stream within which the properties of particles are accurately measured. In this way, the instrument is able to collect the equivalent of 1 sample every 3 minutes or every 1 km (for a ship moving at 10 knots) from the ship’s flow-through seawater system. See [article](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2011.9.466) for more information. SeaFlow performs rapid quantification (up to 24,000 cells per second) of multidimensional characteristics of phytoplankton cells in the pico- to nanophytoplankton size range (0.5-20 µm) to analyze the equivalent of 480 traditional flow cytometry samples per day while on board a research vessel. Image analysis is used to automatically align the laser with the optical system and then monitor and correct for drift.  Data analysis tools have been created to automatically cluster and count phytoplankton populations with geo-referenced data visualization.
