We use high-resolution, continuous observations of marine microorganisms to understand the dynamics of ocean ecosystems and facilitate collaborative research through open data sharing.

The SeaFlow cytometer represents a novel approach to marine ecosystem research, enabling unprecedented spatial and temporal into phytoplankton dynamics. By providing continuous, high-frequency sampling of surface waters, this unique instrument captures marine life at scales never before possible. In over a decade of deployment, SeaFlow has traveled distances equivalent to six global circumnavigations, collecting nearly 850 billion cell measurements. This large dataset allows us to explore phytoplankton interactions from microscopic to ocean-basin scales, revealing intricate details about marine ecosystem structure and function. 

We are always interested in expanding our observational network through collaborations and strategic partnerships with global oceanographic initiatives to map global phytoplankton distributions and interactions. We also develop data portal with advanced visualization tools to make these large datasets accessible to the broader scientific community, promoting collaborative research and deeper understanding of ocean ecosystems.
