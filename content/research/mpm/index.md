We use advanced computational models to understand how environmental changes impact phytoplankton populations and marine ecosystem dynamics.

Our research leverages advanced computational approaches to study the complex interactions within marine ecosystems. By developing innovative matrix population models, we track critical phytoplankton activities including growth, mortality, carbon fixation, respiration, and exudation across different size classes of phytoplankton. These models integrate environmental data to determine how physical and chemical changes reshape marine populations. We are pioneering next-generation models that incorporate environmental stochasticity, explicitly accounting for the inherent randomness and uncertainty in marine systemsâ€”such as the unpredictable dynamics of ocean currents, turbulent water mixing, and sudden environmental fluctuations. 

Our  work has uncovered fascinating insights, such as the light-driven synchrony in *Prochlorococcus* growth and mortality stabilizing the marine food web, and identified critical temperature thresholds that dramatically impact marine productivity. By bridging observational data with computational modeling, we aim to create more accurate predictive frameworks that can help us understand and predict the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.
