Our research leverages advanced computational approaches to unravel the complex interactions within marine ecosystems. By developing innovative matrix population models, we track critical phytoplankton activities including growth, mortality, carbon fixation, respiration, and exudation across different size classes. These models integrate environmental data to reveal how physical and chemical changes reshape marine populations. We are pioneering next-generation models that incorporate environmental stochasticity, addressing the inherent randomness of oceanic mixing processes. Our recent work has uncovered fascinating insights, such as the light-driven synchrony in *Prochlorococcus* growth and mortality, and identified critical temperature thresholds that dramatically impact marine productivity. By bridging observational data with computational modeling, we aim to create more accurate predictive frameworks that can help us understand and anticipate the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.
