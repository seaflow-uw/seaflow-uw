This research builds upon the achievements of the SeaFlow project (2021-2024), which involved analyzing flow cytometry data from over 100 cruises. Our primary focus is on estimating cell growth and turnover rates across various phytoplankton populations, two critical traits that influence how organisms interact with their environment. Leveraging the size-structured matrix population model developed by our team, our initial phase generated 180 estimates of *Prochlorococcus* growth rates. The goal of this new proposal is to estimate not only cell growth but also cell mortality, carbon loss, and carbon fixation across all phytoplankton populations captured by SeaFlow. This comprehensive approach will offer critical insights into both the drivers (growth and productivity) and consequences (loss and turnover) of ecological processes driven by these phytoplankton populations. This knowledge will be instrumental in predicting how primary production and ecosystem health may change in response to environmental shifts.
