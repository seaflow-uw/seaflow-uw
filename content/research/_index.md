Our research group focuses on understanding the critical role of marine phytoplankton in ocean ecosystems and climate change. By developing innovative technologies like the SeaFlow cytometer, we conduct high-resolution observations of phytoplankton population dynamics across ocean transition zones, capturing unprecedented spatial and temporal data. Our approach integrates advanced computational modeling, including matrix population models, to track phytoplankton activities and understand how environmental pressures reshape marine ecosystems. Our group aims to improve climate change predictions by integrating high-resolution biological data into Earth system models, with a particular emphasis on understanding how small-sized phytoplankton respond to and influence environmental shifts. Ultimately, our interdisciplinary research seeks to enhance our understanding of ocean-climate feedbacks and inform critical climate mitigation strategies.
