Our interdisciplinary team studies how phytoplankton will respond to a changing climate and what that means for the future of our planet. We use <b>advanced technologies</b> like the SeaFlow cytometer to collect high-resolution observations of phytoplankton populations across ocean basins, generating unprecedented spatial and temporal data. These observations then drive <b>innovative computational models</b>, including matrix population models, that track phytoplankton activities and inform how environmental pressures, such as ocean warming, reshape marine ecosystems. We place a particular emphasis on understanding <b>how small-sized phytoplankton respond to and influence these environmental shifts</b>. We then work closely with climate scientists to integrate our findings into Earth system models and improve climate change predictions.
