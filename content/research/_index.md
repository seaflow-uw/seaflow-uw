Our research group focuses on understanding the critical role of marine phytoplankton in ocean ecosystems and climate change. We develop <b>advanced technologies</b>, like the SeaFlow cytometer, to conduct high-resolution observations of phytoplankton populations across ocean basins, capturing unprecedented spatial and temporal data. This data feeds <b>innovative computational models</b>, including matrix population models, which track phytoplankton activities and reveal how environmental pressures reshape marine ecosystems. We work closely with climate scientists, integrating our findings into Earth system models to improve climate change predictions. We place a particular emphasis on understanding <b>how small-sized phytoplankton respond to and influence environmental shifts</b>. Ultimately, our interdisciplinary research seeks to understand ocean-climate feedback and inform critical climate mitigation strategies.
