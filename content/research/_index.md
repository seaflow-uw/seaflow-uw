Our interdisciplinary team is working to predict how phytoplankton will respond to a changing climate and what that means for the future of our planet. We develop <b>advanced technologies</b>, like the SeaFlow cytometer, to conduct high-resolution observations of phytoplankton populations across ocean basins, capturing unprecedented spatial and temporal data. This data feeds <b>innovative computational models</b>, including matrix population models, which track phytoplankton activities and reveal how environmental pressures, such as ocean warming, reshape marine ecosystems. We place a particular emphasis on understanding <b>how small-sized phytoplankton respond to and influence these environmental shifts</b>. Finally, we work closely with climate scientists, integrating our findings into Earth system models to improve climate change predictions and ultimately inform climate mitigation strategies.
