Our interdisciplinary team studies how phytoplankton respond to changing ocean conditions and what that means for the future of our planet. We use advanced technologies like the SeaFlow cytometer to collect high-resolution observations of phytoplankton populations across ocean basins, generating unprecedented spatial and temporal data. These observations then drive innovative computational models>, including matrix population models, that track phytoplankton activities and inform how environmental pressures, such as ocean warming, reshape marine ecosystems. We then work closely with climate scientists to integrate our findings into Earth system models and improve climate change predictions.
