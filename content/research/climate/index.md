We investigate how climate change impacts phytoplankton in marine ecosystems to develop more accurate climate change predictions.

Understanding how marine ecosystems respond to climate change is at the heart of our research. We investigate the intricate relationships between environmental shifts and phytoplankton population dynamics, with a particular focus on transition zones where biodiversity and primary production are most sensitive. Our research has revealed how physical disturbances and nutrient fluctuations reshape marine communities, highlighting the critical role of small-sized phytoplankton with rapid growth rates and higher resilience. By integrating high-resolution biological observations into Earth system models, we are developing more accurate climate change predictions. 

Our work has profound implications, particularly for tropical regions experiencing severe warming trends. We are especially concerned about potential declines in key microorganisms like *Prochlorococcus*, which could trigger dramatic cascading effects throughout marine food webs and global carbon cycling. Ultimately, our aim is to create interdisciplinary research that not only advances scientific understanding but also provides crucial insights for developing effective climate mitigation strategies.
