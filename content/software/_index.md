Our research group generates large-scale, basin-wide flow-cytometry data to understand temporal and spatial variability in phytoplankton communities. By developing computational tools and statistical models, we aim to understand how these tiny organisms grow, interact with their environment, and contribute to the global carbon cycle. Our ultimate goal is to shed light on the crucial role phytoplankton play in the ocean ecosystem and predict how they will respond to a changing climate.
